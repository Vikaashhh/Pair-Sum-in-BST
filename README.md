# 🌳 Day 91 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 📌 Problem: Pair Sum in a BST
### 📋 Problem Statement:
Given a Binary Search Tree and a target value, determine whether there exists a pair of nodes whose sum equals the target.
This is the classic "Two Sum" problem revisited in the context of BSTs.

## 🧠 Strategy Breakdown:
🔹 Inorder Traversal — to convert the BST into a sorted array
🔹 Two-Pointer Technique — to efficiently check if a valid pair exists that sums to the target

This method ensures O(n) time and O(n) space complexity.

## 📊 Output Stats:
✅ Test Cases Passed: 41 / 41

⚡ Time Taken: 1.79 sec

🏆 Accuracy: 100%

🎯 Score: 4 / 4

📈 Total Score: 349

## 🪄 Key Takeaway:
“Sometimes, the right solution is just two pointers away.” 🔁
